# Product Planning Skill

An AI agent skill that transforms product ideas into structured, research-backed planning reports — complete with design concepts, strategic analysis, feature roadmaps, and actionable next steps.

## How It Works

Share a product idea and the skill will:

1. **Understand** your idea and ask clarifying questions if needed
2. **Research** the market — competitors, market size, user pain points, and trends via web search
3. **Analyze** using proven frameworks (JTBD, Lean Canvas, competitive analysis, and more)
4. **Generate** a comprehensive product planning report

## Triggers

- "I have an idea for..."
- "Help me plan a product"
- "What features should this product have?"
- "Create a product plan for..."
