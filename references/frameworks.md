# Product Planning Frameworks

## Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

Use this framework to understand why users "hire" a product.

### Core Questions
1. What progress is the user trying to make?
2. What are the struggles and frustrations with current solutions?
3. What would success look like for the user?

### JTBD Statement Template
> When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].

### Example
> When I'm rushing to work in the morning, I want to quickly find a healthy breakfast option, so I can start my day energized without wasting time.

## Feature Prioritization Methods

### MoSCoW Method
- **M**ust Have: Critical for launch, non-negotiable
- **S**hould Have: Important but not vital
- **C**ould Have: Desirable but not necessary
- **W**on't Have: Not in this release

### RICE Score
- **R**each: How many users will this affect?
- **I**mpact: How much will it move the metric? (3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low)
- **C**onfidence: How sure are you? (100%=high, 80%=medium, 50%=low)
- **E**ffort: How many person-months?

**Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

### Kano Model
- **Basic needs**: Expected features - absence causes dissatisfaction
- **Performance needs**: More is better - linear satisfaction
- **Delighters**: Unexpected features - create wow moments
